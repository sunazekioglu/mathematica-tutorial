# mathematica-tutorial

This is a tutorial to work through some basics in Mathematica, starting out with simple calculations (vectors, matrices, etc), then some basics on functional programming in Mathematica, highlighting the capabilities (like pattern matching) that I've found to be particularly useful. Finally, there's some details on ways to code up stuff specific to symbolically representing amplitudes, followed by a couple of short exercises.  

Please let me know if you find any errors or have any questions!
